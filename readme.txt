A pair of simulations, written in C++, modeling common scheduling algorithms

DiskSimulation.cpp determines the number of tracks traversed by a hard drive's seek arm when using the first come first served, shortest seek time first, and scan-look algorithms.

ProcessSimulation.cpp determines the time (in milliseconds) required for processes to complete using the first come first served, shortest job first, shortest remaining time next, and round robin scheduling algorithms.
